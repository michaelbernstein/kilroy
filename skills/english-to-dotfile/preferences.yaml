# ==========================================================================
# Pipeline Model & Executor Preferences
# ==========================================================================
#
# This file controls model and executor defaults for the english-to-dotfile
# skill when generating .dot pipeline files.
#
# The skill reads this file at the start of Phase 0B (model selection),
# BEFORE fetching the Weather Report or LiteLLM catalog. Values here act
# as defaults that the Weather Report and user overrides can supersede.
#
# To lock a choice, set the value. To let the skill pick dynamically,
# leave it blank ("").
#

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Default models per pipeline role
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Each pipeline node has a "class" that determines which model runs it.
# Set a model ID here to lock that role to a specific model. Leave blank
# to let the skill choose from the Weather Report + LiteLLM catalog.
#
# Roles:
#   default — general implementation nodes (no class attribute)
#   hard    — complex implementation nodes (class="hard")
#   verify  — verification/test-runner nodes (class="verify")
#   review  — final review nodes (class="review")
#
# Example values: "gpt-5.3-codex", "claude-opus-4-6", "gemini/gemini-3-pro-preview"

defaults:
  models:
    default: ""
    hard: ""
    verify: ""
    review: ""

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Executor preference
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Whether pipeline nodes should execute via CLI agents or direct API calls.
# This is a single global setting — individual providers handle it via their
# own CLI binaries (codex for OpenAI, claude for Anthropic, gemini for Google).
#
# Supported values: "cli" or "api"
#
# "cli" means the Attractor engine invokes a CLI agent (codex, claude, etc.)
# that manages its own tool use, file I/O, and retries.
#
# "api" means the engine calls the provider's HTTP API directly and manages
# tool use itself.
#
# The skill falls back to API if the preferred CLI binary isn't installed.

executor: "cli"
